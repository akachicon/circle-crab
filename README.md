# circle-crab
Client-side game based on Phaser.js.
The idea is that a player moves the crab to resolve color arcs as quickly as possible. Once the limit has been reached the game is over. High control over speed and colors of different elements is presented. Level creation is easy enough with thorough description of what variables are supposed to (see 0.js level). Spriter animations were imported for Phaser.js with a special lib, Require.js is also used.

The game may be tried [here](https://circle-crab.herokuapp.com).
